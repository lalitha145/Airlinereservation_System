# Airlinereservation_System
Introduction:

    In this project, Iâ€™ll show you how to create an Airline reservation system using java. This is a command-line user interface-based
airline reservation system that allows you to check seat availability and reserve a seat if it is available. The system is designed with a switch case
that gives you three options: view available seats, and reserve a seat. So, get a cup of coffee and use the airline reservation system.

Explanation:


This Command-Line User Interface (CLI)-based Airline Reservation System provides a simple and easy way for checking seat availability and
reserving a seat if it is available. The system includes a simple command line interface with a switch case for executing viewing available 
seats and reserving a seat.

Switch Case, while loop, and Scanner class are used to build this system. The system will first present the user with the available options.
View available seats, book a seat, and EXIT is available as a choice. The user must choose a useful option. The operation will be carried out as
per the input choice.  The seats are stored in array seats, where 0 indicates an available seat and 1 represents a reserved seat.
